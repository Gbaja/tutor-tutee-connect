## How 

Tech stack: Html, Css, Javascript, ExpressJS, Express handlebars, Postgresql.

Middlewares/Modules: pgpromise, validator, express-session, connect-flash, nodemailer, bcryptjs.


## Why

This website was designed and developed by me for practise purpose only. Not  for commercial use.

I used this project an opportunity to  consolidate and demonstrate my knowledge of the tech stack used.

## Thoughts

After learning express and handlebars on my course, I felt like I needed to do something to help me understand better and to learn more about middleswares/npm modules  This project allowed me to do so and I was also able to implement some server side validation. I have a few tables(more than necessary) on purpose help me build on my understanding of relationships in sql. This also ties in to why I have long form

I used promise for the first time in this project mostly through using the pg-promise npm module, I might have got carried a way with the then's aswell (ðŸ™ˆ). I have learnt a better way to chain my promises to make code cleaer and more readable. Another thing I have since learnt is how to handle errors in express.
